# S23 Dev Bootcamp Exercises
This repository contains all the exercises and resources needed for the Spring 23 Dev Bootcamp.

## Submitting Projects & Exercises
Throughout this bootcamp, bootcampers will submit projects and exercises through GitHub. We will utilize GitHub Organizations to make this happen. 

At the beginning of the semester, Bootcampers should download the `bootcamp-s23` repository. This repo contains information and starter code for lectures, exercises, and projects. Once the repo is downloaded, bootcampers should:
- create a new repo named `bootcamp-s23-name` in the organization
- rename the folder they downloaded to `bootcamp-s23-name`
- follow the instructions given on the new repo README
	- initialize a git repo
	- add changes
	- commit changes
	- add a remote
	- create a main branch
	- push changes

Bootcampers now have their very own repo in the organization where they can push their code to.
