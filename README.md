# S23 Dev Bootcamp Exercises
This repository contains all the exercises and resources needed for the Spring 23 Dev Bootcamp.

## Submitting Projects & Exercises
Throughout this bootcamp, bootcampers will submit projects and exercises through GitHub. We will utilize GitHub Organizations to make this happen. 

At the beginning of the semester, Bootcampers should fork the `bootcamp-s23` repository into this organization. This repo contains information and starter code for lectures, exercises, and projects. Once the repo is forked, bootcampers should:
- name the new repo `bootcamp-s23-name`
- clone the repo onto their computer

Bootcampers now have their very own repo in the organization where they can push their code to. Bootcampers should also frequently **Sync Fork** to make sure they have up-to-date exercises and projects.
