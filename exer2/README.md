# Exercise 2 - Git Ready

## Description
In this exercise, bootcampers will familiarize themselves with Unix Commands, Git, and GitHub. 

## Submission
Collect points for this exercise by creating and having the correct contents for the GitHub repo specified in the Instructions. 

## Instructions
This exercise involves setting up your GitHub repo in the BoG Dev Bootcamp Organization. This repo is where you will submit all exercises throughout the bootcamp. 

1. Go to the [bootcamp-s23](https://github.com/BoG-Dev-Bootcamp/bootcamp-s23) repo on GitHub
2. Click **Fork** in the top right corner
3. Change the **Owner** to **BoG-Dev-Bootcamp**
4. Rename the repo `bootcamp-s23-yourname`
5. Click **Create Fork**
6. When the new repo has been created, click **Code** and **SSH** and copy the text
7. Open Terminal or Git Bash on your computer and clone the repo with the command `git clone git@github.com:BoG-Dev-Bootcamp/bootcamp-s23-yourname.git` (make sure you know where this folder is located for future reference)
8. Navigate into the `bootcamp-s23-yourname` directory that was just created via the clone command
9. Navigate into the `exer2` folder
10. Create a new file called `hello.txt`
11. Write some text in this file (+bootie points 🍑 if you can do this from the terminal)
	- if you edited the file from the terminal, write what command you used to do this in the text file
12. Stage, commit, and push these changes to GitHub

**Word of advice for future exercises** -> Before starting an exercise, make sure your repo is up-to-date with the main repo. Check by clicking **Sync Fork** and **Update branch** if needed.
